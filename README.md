To run the code for yourself, sign in to RStudio Cloud and follow the instructions at the start of the help guide.

## Running the Code Locally

If you want to run this code locally, you will need both RStudio and Git installed. We will assume the former is setup using the [notes from our R course](https://warwickdatascience.github.io/into-the-tidyverse/resources/session_one/session_one_presentation.html). The latter can be installed using [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and connected to RStudio using [these](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html). Then, create a new project from Version Control > Git and copy in the repository url from the help file. Run `renv::restore()` to install required packages.

If you have any trouble with the above steps, please contact the repository maintainer, [Tim Hargreaves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hargreaves/), or reach out at [teaching@warwickdatascience.com](mailto:teaching@warwickdatascience.com).
